☐ Move to separate GitHub as 
☐ Add support for passing arguments on command line (raw)
☐ Add support for passing arguments on command line (via JSON descriptor)
☐ Document
☐ Add support for JSON validation
	☐ Look into supporting validating against a JSON schema using JsonSchema.Net
	☐ Look into implementing a basic custom format (loosely based on LINQ queries) to validate constraints such as:
		☐ Detecting duplicate primary keys
		☐ Detecting missing foreign keys
		☐ Detecting missing required fields (maybe already covered by schema)
		☐ Detecting orphaned (unused) items
☐ Setup GitHub actions to generate release builds that show up on  GitHub releases
	☐ Release version 1
☐ Support taking pull requests
☐ Implement some unit testing that run with GitHub actions and show up via status badges in README
